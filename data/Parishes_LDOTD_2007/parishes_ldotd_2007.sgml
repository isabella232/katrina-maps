Louisiana Parish Boundaries approved by Resolution of the GIS Council on January 19, 2000.
This is a region dataset depicting the polygon boundaries of the 64 parishes comprising the state of Louisiana.  Parish boundaries extend 3 miles out into the Gulf of Mexico from the coastline.  This dataset was derived from many data sources and conveys the best currently (2005) available representation of the parishes of Louisiana and as a consequence, the best currently available representation of the territorial bounds of the state.
</abstract>
<purpose>Provide a GIS Layer containing the best existing line work available representing the parish boundaries portraying nominal attributes for each parish.</purpose>
<supplinf>
Revisions:
(1)   Extensions of Parish Boundaries in Lake Maurepas and Lake Pontchartrain in accordance with Legislative Acts 740           of 1979, Regular Session and 229 of 1980, Regular Session that made some correction to Act 740 were                          completed October, 2001.
(2)  Took the source data for the parishes and projected them into the LADOMAIN projection in UTM NAD 1983 in February, 2007.

<logic>This feature class was developed using original linework that was manually digitized using USGS Quadrangle Maps along with legal parish boundary descriptions. Anomalies will be noted between these data compiled by LADOTD and boundaries that are depicted in other reference data sets (e.g. USGS DRGs).  The depiction of boundaries in this data set has been heavily researched and is believed to be a better representation of the actual boundary than USGS sources. After careful examination conducted by the Louisiana GIS Council, it was resolved to use these boundaries as the most accurate data available on January 19, 2000.</logic>

Dataset copied. LADOTD PARISH data (64 files) were projected from polyconic to UTM zone 15, NAD27 coordinates to be compatible with reference data (DRGs).  All other digital vector data (LOSLSABINE, LOSLPEARL, STATE_FEDERAL) were projected to UTM zone 15, NAD27 coordinates using Intergraph MGE software.  The digital vector data in the common coordinate system were spliced together.  The legal description data (LOSLLAKES) was converted to a digital representation and spliced into the other composite data.  Line cleaning and processing was performed on the composite.

The resultant .dgn file was converted to an Arc/Info coverage, topology was built, and the dataset projected to geographic coordinates NAD83.  The Arc/Info dataset was converted to a feature class and the attributes of each parish polygon populated using LADOTD data.

The feature class was modified to portray changes made to the parish boundaries in accordance with Legislative action to clarify boundary alignments.
