Dataset copied. LADOTD PARISH data (64 files) were projected from polyconic to UTM zone 15, NAD27 coordinates to be compatible with reference data (DRGs).  All other digital vector data (LOSLSABINE, LOSLPEARL, STATE_FEDERAL) were projected to UTM zone 15, NAD27 coordinates using Intergraph MGE software.  The digital vector data in the common coordinate system were spliced together.  The legal description data (LOSLLAKES) was converted to a digital representation and spliced into the other composite data.  Line cleaning and processing was performed on the composite.
<P>
The resultant .dgn file was converted to an Arc/Info coverage, topology was built, and the dataset projected to geographic coordinates NAD83.  The Arc/Info dataset was converted to a feature class and the attributes of each parish polygon populated using LADOTD data.
<P>
The feature class was modified to portray changes made to the parish boundaries in accordance with Legislative action to clarify boundary alignments.

This feature class was developed using original linework that was manually digitized using USGS Quadrangle Maps along with legal parish boundary descriptions. Anomalies will be noted between these data compiled by LADOTD and boundaries that are depicted in other reference data sets (e.g. USGS DRGs).  The depiction of boundaries in this data set has been heavily researched and is believed to be a better representation of the actual boundary than USGS sources. After careful examination conducted by the Louisiana GIS Council, it was resolved to use these boundaries as the most accurate data available on January 19, 2000.
